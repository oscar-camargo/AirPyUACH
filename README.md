Often enough, I found myself in a tight spot where there's just too much information regarding Aircraft Design. Not only is there too much to read, but each author has a different approach to this area. Therefore, I thought I could propose a methodology that synthesizes the main ideas from all the authors that I've read.

# To Do
### Well-defined Modules
- [x] Sizing Main Window Frontend
- [ ] Sizing Secondary Windows Frontend
- [ ] Sizing Backend
### Planned modules, not well-defined yet.
- [ ] Fidelity Zero Aerodynamics Module 
- [ ] Fidelity Zero Performance Module
- [ ] Fidelity Zero Flight Mechanics Module
- [ ] Fidelity Zero Filter
- [ ] Fidelity One Aerodynamics Module 
- [ ] Fidelity One Performance Module
- [ ] Fidelity One Flight Mechanics Module
- [ ] Fidelity One Filter

**The previous methods are intended for rapid development of design concepts. They're the most useful for small aircraft that are cheap to manufacture, in order to obtain experimental data more quickly**

### Situational: Development of the following module depends on the amount of time I have
- [ ] Fidelity Two Aerodynamics Module (Perhaps, linking a geometry to OpenFoam, SU2, or other CFD solvers)
- [ ] Fidelity Two Performance Module
- [ ] Fidelity Two Flight Mechanics Module
- [ ] Fidelity Two Filter
- [ ] Human-assisted Genetic Algorithms
