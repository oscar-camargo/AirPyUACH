Often enough, I found myself in a tight spot where there's just too much information regarding Aircraft Design. Not only is there too much to read, but each author has a different approach to this area. Therefore, I thought I could propose a methodology that synthesizes the main ideas from all the authors that I've read.

# To Do
### Well-defined Modules
- [x] Sizing Main Window Frontend
- [ ] Sizing Secondary Windows Frontend
- [ ] Sizing Backend
### Planned modules, not well-defined yet.
- [ ] Airfoil Analysis (XFOIL)
- [ ] Fidelity Zero Aerodynamics Module (Potential, Inviscid Flow Panel/Grid Methods)
- [ ] Fidelity Zero Performance Module
- [ ] Fidelity Zero Flight Mechanics Module (Simplified Linear Approximations)
- [ ] Fidelity Zero Filter (Algorithms for configurations selection, G-A?)
- [ ] Fidelity One Aerodynamics Module (Viscous, more refined Panel/Grid Methods (Vortex Particle Wake?))
- [ ] Fidelity One Performance Module
- [ ] Fidelity One Flight Mechanics Module (Full Linearized Equations)
- [ ] Fidelity One Filter (Same as Zero Filter)

**The previous methods are intended for rapid development of design concepts. They're the most useful for small aircraft that are cheap to manufacture, in order to obtain experimental data more quickly**

### Situational: Development of the following module depends on the amount of time I have (These require a TREMENDOUS amount of work)
- [ ] Fidelity Two Aerodynamics Module (Perhaps, linking a geometry to OpenFoam, SU2, or other CFD solvers)
- [ ] Fidelity Two Performance Module
- [ ] Fidelity Two Flight Mechanics Module (Numerically solve non-linear EoM?)
- [ ] Fidelity Two Filter 
- [ ] Loads Module (Aerodynamic - Inertial loads produced according to flight envelope)
- [ ] Fidelity Zero Structural Module (Euler Bernoulli Beam Theory for structures with one or two spars)
- [ ] Fidelity Two Structural Module (Linking a structure to a FEA solver)
- [ ] Human-assisted Genetic Algorithms
